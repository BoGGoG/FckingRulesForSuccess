\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do the fucking work. Don't be lazy.
    \item Stop fucking waiting. It's time.
    \item Rely on yourself. The Universe doesn't give a fuck.
    \item Be fucking practical. Success is not a theory.
    \item Be productive early. Don't fuck around all day.
    \item Don't be a fucking baby. Life's hard. Get on with it.
    \item Don't hangout with fuckwits.
    \item Don't fucking waste energy on shit you can't control.
    \item Stop bullshitting. It's fucking embarrassing.
    \item Stop being a fucking people-pleaser. It's sad.
    \item Stop putting toxic shit in your body. It's fucking stupid.
    \item Stop doing the same fucking thing and hoping shit will change.
